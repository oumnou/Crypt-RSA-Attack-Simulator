# RSA-Attack-Simulator 

Crypte is a simple message encryption application built using the RSA encryption algorithm. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library in Python.


### Features
RSA Encryption: The app uses the RSA encryption algorithm to encrypt messages, ensuring secure communication between parties.

* Key Generation: Crypte generates RSA key pairs consisting of a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

* Message Encryption: Users can enter plaintext messages and encrypt them using the generated RSA public key.

* Message Decryption: Encrypted messages can be decrypted using the corresponding RSA private key.
GUI Interface: The app features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to interact with the application easily.
